  <p>Hello <%= current_player(@conn).name %>! You are logged in.</p>

  <p>Right now, there is not much you can do. Maybe you want to
    <a href="<%= player_path(@conn, :new) %>">register?</a>
    If you are already registered you can of course
    <a href="<%= session_path(@conn, :new) %>">log in.</a></p>
